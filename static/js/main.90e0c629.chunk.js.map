That's right. in 2016, conceptual founders Devan Porter and Adam Simmons were collaborating with a firmwide resource team to develop a concept for an all-virtual design studio. This studio was to be an internal resource comprised of past firm cohorts who were no longer connected to the firm geographically, meaning life had pulled them away from the firm's physical office. Leveraging progressive technology, this virtual team would be distributed throughout the country, yet act as a single studio providing resources to the rest of the firm. The concept was well received but after 2 years of research didn't materialize within the company.</p>\r\n                                    <p className=\"bigText\">In late 2018, Devan, one of the firm's Northwest Regional Technical Directors, saw the opportunity to realize the concept beyond the firm's borders and provide premium design services to the broader AEC industry. Teaming with Adam, one of the firm's Southeast Regional BIM Leaders, along with In-House Counsel Olivia Porter and Brooklyn-based co-founder Amy John, a Service Designer out of Parsons School of Design, this team is empowering the design and build communities with access to shared resources, a connected ecosystem of talented design professionals, and an innovative process for helping small firms deliver big, but stay small.</p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <People count={true} people={this.state.founder}></People>\r\n\r\n
